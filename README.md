# LinkedIn Post Generator LLM

## üöÄ Overview

A custom-built transformer-based Large Language Model designed specifically for generating professional, human-like LinkedIn posts across various themes. This model operates completely independently without any external API dependencies, making it a fully self-contained solution for LinkedIn content generation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üî• Custom Transformer Architecture**: Built from scratch with 12 layers, 16 attention heads, and 512-dimensional embeddings
- **üéØ Theme-Based Generation**: Supports 25+ different LinkedIn post themes (professional, motivational, industry insights, etc.)
- **üß† Advanced Tokenization**: LinkedIn-optimized tokenizer handling hashtags, mentions, URLs, and professional terminology
- **‚ö° Zero External Dependencies**: No OpenAI, Anthropic, or other API calls required
- **üìä Quality Control**: Advanced sampling techniques with temperature and top-p sampling
- **üé® Professional Formatting**: Automatic formatting for LinkedIn-style posts with proper hashtag placement.
